## **🧩 Linux Architecture vs Windows Architecture**

**🪟 Windows Architecture**

```plaintext
User → Shell → Operating System → Hardware
```

* **Shell**: Interface that interacts with the user (GUI or CLI)
    
* **OS**: Handles all system-level operations and hardware communication
    

**🐧 Linux Architecture**

```plaintext
User → Shell → Kernel → Hardware
```

* **Shell**: Interface (like Bash) that takes user commands
    
* **Kernel**: Core of the OS that directly interacts with hardware
    

🔍 In Linux, the **kernel** is a separate layer that manages hardware directly, making it more modular and efficient.

### ⚡ Why Linux is Faster Than Windows

One key reason Linux is faster is its **minimalist design**:

\- Linux can run entirely via **command-line interface (CLI)**, skipping heavy graphical processes

\- It uses fewer background services and system resources

\- It’s highly customizable—users can disable unnecessary components

🧠 *In contrast, Windows relies heavily on GUI and background services, which consume more memory and CPU.*

### 🧾 Linux vs Windows: Common Terminology

| **Windows** | **Linux** |
| --- | --- |
| Administrator | Root User |
| Folder | Directory |
| File | File |
| Software | Package |

🧃 Think of it like different flavors of the same concept—just like orange juice brands!

## **📁 Linux File System Hierarchy vs Windows**

**🪟 Windows File System**

* Starts with `C:\`
    
* Common folders: Program Files, Users, PerfLogs.
    

**🐧 Linux File System**

* Starts with `/` (root directory)

* Tree-like structure with important folders.

### **🔍 Important File-System Hierarchy in Linux**

* **/home**: This directory is used for storing files and folders of regular users.
    
* **/root**: This is the home directory for the root user (administrator), similar to the admin account in Windows.
    
* **/boot**: This directory contains bootable files for Linux, such as `initrd`. When the system is switched off, all files in the `/boot` directory become inactive. When the system or VM is switched on again, these files are reloaded to start the operating system.  
    At system startup, a POST (Power-On Self Test) is performed to check for hardware errors or vulnerabilities. If any issues are detected, the system alerts the user.  
    **Examples :** battery level warnings, hard disk failure, etc.
    
    ⚠️ If any bootable file is deleted, the operating system may become corrupted.  
    In Windows, when you start the system, you might see messages like “Welcome to Windows 11,” “OneDrive not synced,” or “Warning! C drive has low space.”
    
* **/etc**: This directory contains all configuration files, including hardware information like RAM, storage, and processor details.
    
* **/usr**: All software packages are installed by default in this directory.
    
* **/bin**: Known as the binary folder, it contains essential command-line tools used by all users, including the root user.
    
* **/sbin**: This directory contains system commands that are used only by the root user.
    
* **/opt**: Optional application software and packages are stored here.
    
* **/dev**: This is the device folder. It holds information about all connected peripheral devices such as USB drives, mouse, keyboard, hard disk, and other hardware.
    

**🧠 Final Thoughts**

Linux’s architecture is clean, efficient, and built for performance. Its modular design, powerful CLI, and open-source nature make it a favorite among developers, sysadmins, and tech enthusiasts.

Whether you're switching from Windows or just curious, understanding Linux architecture is the first step to mastering it.
